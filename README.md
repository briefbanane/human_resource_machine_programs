Human Resource Machine Programs
===============================

These are most of the programs I wrote during my playthrough of the visual programming game Human Resource Machine.
I added a brief summary of the task description of each level.
Many programs meet both the speed and line count criteria, otherwise there are two programs included in a file.
If you test a program and a criterion is not met or if it doesn't even solve the given task, please file a bug report.
